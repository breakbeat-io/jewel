  Listen Later is a place to store albums you want to listen to later.

  Add and remove albums from any of 8 slots as you think of them, and they'll be there waiting for you when you're ready to listen!

  Send your collection to friends and find out what they're listening to by asking them to send their collection to you.

  Build a Collection Library of your and your friends collections for easy play back later!
